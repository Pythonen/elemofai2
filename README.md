Machine learning to help Tulli/Customs

## Summary

Model to help Tulli with controlling criminal traffic on the border. 
This model could help officials with for example airport security.


## Background
Airports and borders in general are busy and thus, Tulli has nearly 1900 officials working.
In 2019 Tulli did over 890 000 examinations of packages. This could be sped up with the help of machine learning. 

This topic is important because for example dug smuggling has become [huge market in Europe, and it is also reflected in Finland](https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000006361419.html). Recent drug smuggling scandal called ['Katiska'](https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/nama-mittavat-huumemaarat-katiska-jutun-cobra-niko-ranta-aho-myontaa-tallaisen-syytteessa-esitetyn-huumevuoren-han-yha-kiistaa/7806272#gs.ndic65) serves as a good example

In addition to more spesific findings, this [no-human-interaction-process](https://www.hstoday.us/industry/laguardias-new-terminal-opens-with-new-ai-security-screening/) would also be more safe in times like this when global pandemic like Covid-19 is rolling over the world. 


## How is it used?

This could be taken in to action in the same way [Heathrow Airport and Los Angeles International Airport](https://www.airport-technology.com/features/ai-at-airports-security) has done. Los Angeles International Airport has [computed tomography](https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-computed-tomography) scanners which use AI to help them detect threaths.



## Data sources and AI methods
Data can be gathered by the systems as they are detecting deviations; It is a continuos cycle of getting data, learning and then putting that in to action.
